###  This is a Machine learning experience
This was a team effort where we used machine learning to showcase how it might be used in the real world for many types of applications. 
In this case we created a simulation company HappyHomeMortgage Company where we created a simulation loan preapproval. then created a website to showcase the work

In a nutshell: 
<li>Find the best data for our model</li>
<li>Review and clean data using Jupyter Lab</li>
<li>Remove all NAN and null values</li>
<li>Select the features</li>
<li>Plot the data, to visualize the outcome</li>
<li>Choose the right machine learning algorithm</li>
<li>Train test and split your data</li>
<li>Preprocessing</li>
<li>Train and test your model</li>
<li>Hyperparameter Tuning</li>
<li>Save your model, to use for your predict model</li>

How to run my code:
1. Open link above to run deployed site
2. Download my repository and run Index page on local host
3. ML will only run using Jupyter an may take time to run.
