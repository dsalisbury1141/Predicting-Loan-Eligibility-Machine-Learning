              <ul><h4></h4></ul>
                <li><strong>Income:  </strong>Review monthly income including your co borrower if you have one</li>
                <li><strong>Loan obligations:  </strong>The your total monthly debt payments including auto and student loans, credit card minimum payments etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit:  </strong>Review your credit score, resolve any credit issues in the past few years, a credit score is very important but not the only means to approval. </li>
                <li><strong>Affordability:  </strong>How much house you can afford, and how much are you comfortable paying, these are two different things! </li>       
                <li><strong>Down Payment:  </strong>How much cash you can put down, Some loan types require a down payment and others do not. Do your due diligence and learn more. </li>
                <li><strong>Closing Cost:  </strong>Don't forget closing cost!   Closing cost can sneak up on you and can also be a burden on your bank account. </li>

            <p class=text-left><strong>HappyHomeMortgage Company </strong> is a trio of talented students who have completed an intense program at University of Central Florida with Trilogy Education Services called <strong>Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp.</strong>
              This website is a reflection of our collaborated effort and it is our final project. The project is based around Demystifying Machine Learning, and includes the following technologies: 
              <ul>
                <li>Python Pandas</li>
                <li>Matplotlib/Numpy/Seaborne </li>
                <li>HTML/CSS/BOOTSTRAP</li>
                <li>JavaScript/D3.js</li>
                <li>Machine Learning using SKlearn</li>
                <li>JupyterLab</li>
                <li>VSCode</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>

            <p><strong>We will briefly review the process we used to complete this project </strong>
              <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li><strong>DataSet: </strong>https://www.kaggle.com/sohamohajeri/predicting-loan-eligibility-by-machine-learning</li>
                <li><strong>Data Review: </strong> The first step is revie and clean the data we did this using Jupyter Lab.</li>  
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning: </strong> The process begins by removing all NAN or null values that could affect the machine learning once we get to that part of the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Select the Features: </strong> Once the cleaning process has completed, now we select the columns that we plan to use for plotting and Machine Learning. </li>
                <li><strong>Plotting the Data: </strong>Plotting the data is important because it provides a way to look at the data as a visual, sometimes this helps to understand if more changes are needed with the previous processes mentioned above. </li>

                <li><strong>Machine Learning: </strong>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning has many tools or models available to use to obtain the type of algorithms needed to fit your data and intended outcome.  </li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning: </strong>Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulation Created: </strong>The team Decided to create a loan preapproval simulation to show how machine learning would work once the trained model was set to interface new data for decisioning. Visit our simulation here. </li>
